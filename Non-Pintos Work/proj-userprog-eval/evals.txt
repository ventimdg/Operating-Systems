Kamal Nahas|370|20|He took the lead for the Design Doc FPU section and was responsible for creating the entire implementation for Floating Point Operations. He also wrote one of the required tests. He helped contributed to the brainstorming for ideas on how to implement a file descriptor table in file operation syscalls and how to implement the shared data structure in process syscalls for the design document. After finishing and debugging the FPU code, he collaborated with everyone to troubleshoot kernel panics that occurred in the process syscall section. Due to working together in person for most of the project, he also assisted in writing code for anyone who asked for assistance. 
Shaamer Kumar|37|20|He took charge of the design document for Argument Passing and wrote all of the code foundation for it. He also wrote additional test cases and worked on debugging. Most of his work was completed either by collaborating with the team or working one-on-one with everyone to troubleshoot problems with process syscalls, argument passing, or custom test cases. He also spent a significant amount of time working with everyone to debug kernel panics and fix logical errors in order to pass all of the tests and complete the project because he finished argument passing very quickly.
Armaan Mali|69|20|He took the lead role for Process Syscalls for both the design document and coding. He wrote nearly all of the code for Process Syscalls. To gain a better understanding of Process Syscalls and help everyone else understand, he would go to office hours to get clarification on questions no one knew the answer to. He participated in all group work sessions and offered assistance to others as needed, but his primary focus was on working on Process Syscalls.
