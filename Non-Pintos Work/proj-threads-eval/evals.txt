Kamal Nahas|370|20|He took charge of the design doc and designed out the alarm clock relatively on his own and was a key component of everything we designed. Kamal also took charge of coding user threads and worked with me to help complete it. He also helped debug different parts of the project as he was a great resource to the team.  He also debugged heavily with me on User threads. 
Shaamer Kumar|37|20|He helped on every part and was there for all the worksessions. He helped debug and code Strict Priority Scheduler, alarm clock, and User threads with me and was also monumental in getting the design doc completed. He finished all the concept check questions for the design doc on his own. He took charge of reading through all the tests and wrote our custom test for the project by himself. 
Armaan Mali|69|20|He worked with all of us on the first two tasks of Alarm Clock and Strict Priority Scheduler. While writing the design doc, he collaborated with Kamal, me, and Shaamer on coming up with an implementation especially for lock donations. While coding, he assisted when it came to debugging Strict Priority Scheduler with me and Shaamer and part of the beginning of user threads which was headed by Kamal and me.
